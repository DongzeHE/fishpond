\title{Fishpond: differential expression accounting for inferential uncertainty}
\description{
This package provides statistical methods and other tools for
working with Salmon and Alevin quantification of RNA-seq data.
In particular, it contains the Swish non-parametric method for
detecting differential transcript expression (DTE). Swish can
also be used to detect differential gene expresion (DGE),
to perform allelic analysis, or to assess changes in isoform
proportions.
}
\details{
The main functions are:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{scaleInfReps}} - scaling transcript or gene expression data
\item \code{\link{labelKeep}} - labelling which features have sufficient counts
\item \code{\link{swish}} - perform non-parametric differential analysis
\item Plots, e.g., \code{\link{plotMASwish}}, \code{\link{plotInfReps}}
}
