Changes in version 1.1.22
+ Working on a faster version of Swish which only
  computes the ranks of the data once, and then re-uses
  this for the permutation distribution. This by-passes
  the addition of uniform noise per permutation, but
  shouldn't negatively affect inference and is 8x faster.

Changes in version 1.1.18
+ Adding Rcpp-based function readEDS() written by
  Avi Srivastava which imports the sparse counts stored
  in Alevin's Efficient Data Storage (EDS) format.

Changes in version 1.1.10
+ Changed the vignette so that it (will) use a linkedTxome,
  as sometime the build would break if the Bioc build
  machine couldn't access ftp.ebi.ac.uk.

Changes in version 1.1.6
+ Add 'computeInfRV' function. InfRV is not used in the
  Swish methods, only for visualization purposes in the
  Swish paper.

Changes in version 1.1.1
+ removed 'samr' from Imports, as it required source
  installation, moved to Suggests, for optional qvalue
  calculation

Changes in version 0.99.30
+ added two interaction tests, described in ?swish
+ incorporate qvalue package for pvalue, locfdr and qvalue
+ added plotMASwish() to facilitate plotting
+ wilcoxP is removed, and the mean is used instead

Changes in version 0.99.0
+ fishpond getting ready for submission to Bioc
