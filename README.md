## Fishpond: differential expression accounting for inferential uncertainty

Fishpond contains methods for differential transcript and gene
expression analysis of RNA-seq data using inferential replicates for
uncertainty of abundance quantification, as generated by Gibbs
sampling or bootstrap sampling. Also the package contains utilities
for working with *Salmon*, *alevin*, and *alevin-fry*
quantification data.
